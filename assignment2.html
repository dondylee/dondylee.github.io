            <h1>A2: Parametric Modelling with Grasshopper</h1>

            <p>
                This assignment asked us to create a parametric model using a Grasshopper definition. For this assignment, I decided to build out the design I created last week. However, I added parameters such that (1) the intersection slots could be wider, (2) the design could be larger, and (3) the model could vary according to the cardboard width.
            </p>

            <p>
                The steps I went through consisted of four main phases. To begin, I created the basic shapes that would be fundamental for my design, which are a circle and rectangle. I used number sliders so that the model would be parametric, and the measurements I used were consistent with my Assignment 1.

            </p>

            <p>
                Next, similar to the steps I used in Assignment 1, I added a polar array component to add intersecting slots at all angles. Afterwards, I trimmed the flatten curves twice: once to get the circle with trimmed outer edges and another to get the rectangles with trimmed outer edges. Joining these curves would give us our desired design. As a final step, I added the Extrude component against the z-axis along with a number slider to allow the model to account for different cardboard thickness.

            </p>

            <p>
                To make the files easier to understand for anyone seeing my work, I organized my components and added notes that highlight (1) what each number slider changes and (2) which component to bake.

            <p>
                The advantages of parametric modelling is that I can quickly make different dimensions of the kit. Thus, I decided to create different sizes of the kit. I first changed the radius of the circle by making versions that are bigger and smaller than the original. Then, I also tested out different lengths for the intersections slots to see which fits better. Finally, in my previous design, the intersection slot was too tight, and so I quickly increased the intersection slot width from 4.2mm to 5mm.

            <p>
                I placed the circles on the laser cutting platform to cut many copies of each while placing enough distance between them. I used the same settings as last time, except this time, I did two passes in order to ensure the kits would be cut conveniently.

            <p>
                Then I pressed cut and the laser printing started.

            </p>

            <p>
                Here's my final design, which kind of made a triangular model that looks consistent from all angles.
