            <p>
                This assignment asked us to create a box in one of two ways: (1) CNC milling or (2) 3D printing. I chose the former option because I wanted to try out a different method. Therefore, for my overall process, I first built my design on Rhino, set up my DXF on KiCAD, imported my Gerber files to Bantam Tools, and then went to the Mill to cut.
            </p>

            <p>
                To begin, I started laying out my pieces on Rhino. I measured the RF1 copper board and found that it was 10cm x 7cm. Thus, I created a rectangle of that size for reference on Rhino. Then, I used the polyline segments tool to create the outlines, which will be connected with finger edge joints that have dogbones. 
            </p>

            </p>

            <p>
                Afterwards, I worked on the engraving that would go on my pieces. I decided on Pepe because I was feeling down this week (like Pepe). I first found a line drawing of Pepe and then used the Vectorize plug-in to transform the image into a curve. I scaled the image down to 50% and then placed it on top of my big piece. 
            </p>

            </p>

            <p>
                Following the instructions on the class slides, I separated the cutting and engraving paths, exported them as DXF files, and then set them up on KiCAD. On KiCAD, I checked that the designs matched my Rhino files, and then I plotted my designs as Gerber files. Afterwards, I went to the Mill to cut. I imported and configured my files onto Bantam Tools and used these measurements: Trace Depth: 0.15 mm; Zoffset = 1.55 mm. 
            </p>

            </p>

            <p>
                When I started printing, however, I experienced failure twice because the copper boards kept flying out of its position. Therefore, to resolve this, I made sure to cover the entire backside with tape and also reduced the Feed Rate and Spindle Rate to 80%. Furthermore, I experience a problem with the homing of the spindle--the position of the spindle did not match the preview on Bantam Tools. Nevertheless, I continued the print as a test run.

            </p>
            
            <p>
                The print was good; however, the spindle broke. Thus, I changed the spindle and prepared for the cut that includes the edges. After printing, I realized the spindle may have been thicker than my original spindle, which is the reason why so much of Pepe was shaved off. I also realized that my pieces did not fit.

            <p>
                As a result, I went back to Rhino and redid the design. I made sure that the width of the insertion slots were precisely matching.

                I went back to the Mill to cut my parts while anticipating this version would work. However, eventhough the parts lined up on Rhino, the pieces that I cut did not line up. The reason could be that the spindle that I used was too thick or that my setting was off. Thus, I plan to print again with a different setting or spindle.

            <p>
                This is my final outcome! Do you see Pepe?
